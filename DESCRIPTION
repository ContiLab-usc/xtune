Title: Regularized Regression with Feature-specific Penalties Integrating External Information
Version: 0.99.0
Authors@R: 
  c(person(given = "Jingxuan",
           family = "He",
           role = c("aut", "cre"),
           email = "hejingxu@usc.edu"),
    person(given = "Chubing",
           family = "Zeng",
           role = "aut"))
Description: Extends standard penalized regression (Lasso, Ridge, and Elastic-net) to allow feature-specific shrinkage based on external information with the goal of achieving a better prediction accuracy and variable selection. Examples of external information include the grouping of predictors, prior knowledge of biological importance, external p-values, function annotations, etc. The choice of multiple tuning parameters is done using an Empirical Bayes approach. A majorization-minimization algorithm is employed for implementation.
